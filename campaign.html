      When I realised my album release shows for my new album <em>Lukamari</em> in Nepal had to be cancelled due to the outbreak of COVID-19, I was a bit dazed, not sure how to take this uncertain change of plans. Having taken over a year to write the album, 4 months of recording / production work, quitting my job and travelling to Nepal, I was really looking forward to playing these shows just like how I had seen it in my head. At this point the sheer scale of this pandemic had not registered through me. I went from planning to playing shows around Nepal to being locked down in a house for over a month. Eventually being in isolation in this lockdown opened my eyes to the disastrous magnitude of the situation we were in.
    </p>
    <p class="py-2">
      During lockdown, I with my friends formed a team and came up with an idea to build a website to release my new album through a digital platform (this website). Listeners were able to purchase and download the album for a digital copy of <em>Lukamari</em>. Our sole intention to develop this platform was to donate all the proceeds from the album to an organisation  that were dedicated to help families affected by this pandemic and nationwide lockdown.

    <p class="py-2">
      We started to look for foundations that were actively tackling this problem and came across <a href="https://facebook.com/NepalCoronavirusResponseGroup" target="_blank">Nepal Coronavirus Response Group</a>.
      They provide a comprehensive list of organizations, groups and individuals who are working in the front-line to provide help to the most vulnerable and needy during the coronavirus lockdown in Nepal.
      Through this, we got in touch with Kusum Tamang (Project Head) of <a href="#hiteri">Hiteri</a> and Deepak Chapagain (President) of <a href="#vcn">Volunteer Corps Nepal</a>, and decided to partner with them as part of our campaign.

      We ended our fund raising campaign on 27th April, 2020. We received an incredible amount of positive responses from listeners in Nepal and abroad.
      With their generous support and donations, along with our <a href="#lukamari-supporters">sponsors</a>, we were able to move on to our next step, funds allocation and distribution.
      Here is a simple breakdown of how its been distributed:
